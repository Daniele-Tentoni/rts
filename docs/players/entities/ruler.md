A ruler is the king of the kingdom and has to defend and attack [Towers](/players/entities/tower). You can directly control it. He does not have any role at the moment. You can turn around the map and no more.

## Controls

You can control your ruler using `W` `A` `S` `D` or arrows keys. You can move every where in the map but not outside of it.

## Enemy rulers

Enemy rulers will try to conquer your realm, so you have to defend it by conquering their too! In a Singleplayer game, you have only enemies as computer bots, but in Multiplayer games, you will fight other people from around the world using your internet connection or you could build your own self-hosted server to play with your friends in your lan.
