# Ruler

A ruler is the king of the kingdom and has to defend and attack [Towers](/players/entities/tower). You can directly control it. He does not have any role at the moment. You can turn around the map and no more.

## Controls

You can control your ruler using `WASD` or arrows keys. You can move every where in the map but not outside of it.
