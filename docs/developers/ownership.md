# Ownership

The ownership means that an object in the current game has an owner that control it. For a soldier, the ownership is the tower, but for routes and towers the ownership is the ruler

It has to be already updated when something changes, when a soldier conquer a tower, it changes the ownership of the tower to the him owner.

With it we can check whenever a soldier collide with another one if they are enemies or not and do things accordingly.

At this time (alpha release), not every object has an ownership value.
